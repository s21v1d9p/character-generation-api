Here is exactly what I need. I will handle the UI, so your focus is the backend and GPU pipeline that I will connect to via API.

PROJECT SUMMARY

Backend for Modular, Scalable AI Character Image and Video Generation (LoRA Based, Easy Character Creation)**

I need a backend system that generates high quality images and video clips of recurring characters, each defined by a LoRA.
The backend must be API driven, modular, and scalable.
I will build a separate UI that talks to your API.

A major requirement is that I must be able to create new characters easily by providing reference images, without pipeline rewrites or manual intervention.

1. LoRA Based Character System

(Important: I provide images, system trains the LoRA automatically)

Each character in the system will be represented by a LoRA file.

Critical requirement:
I must be able to create new characters by simply providing ~20 reference images and a chosen character name.

The system should then:
	1.	Run a standardized LoRA training process
	2.	Output a .safetensors LoRA file for that character
	3.	Automatically register that LoRA in the character library
	4.	Make the new character instantly usable through the API

I do not want to manually run training scripts, edit configs, or modify workflows.

Additional LoRA requirements:
	•	The training pipeline should be standardized and repeatable.
	•	Adding characters should be fast.
	•	The backend must dynamically load the correct LoRA file based on character_id.
	•	No duplication of workflows or backend logic when new characters are added.

This “drop in images → get a new character” workflow is a key part of the project.

You will deliver a clean API that I can connect to from my own UI.

Required endpoints:

Character Management
	•	List characters
	•	Register a new character (LoRA file created via the automated training pipeline)
	•	Store metadata for each character

Generation
	•	POST /generate-image
	•	POST /generate-video

Inputs include:
	•	character_id
	•	Prompt
	•	Any image or video settings

Outputs:
	•	Cloud storage URLs for the generated assets

The API should hide all the complexity of ComfyUI or underlying model orchestration.

3. GPU Pipeline (RunPod preferred)

You will set up a GPU pipeline that:
	•	Runs ComfyUI or an equivalent backend engine
	•	Uses SDXL as the base model (or another high quality model)
	•	Loads the appropriate LoRA dynamically per request
	•	Generates character consistent still images
	•	Generates videos using an image to video model (Stable Video Diffusion, etc)
	•	Saves results to cloud storage
	•	Integrates cleanly with the API layer

Once set up, I should never need to manually interact with ComfyUI.

4. Modularity and Scalability (Very Important)

The architecture must make it easy to scale to many characters.

Specifically:
	•	Adding new LoRAs must require no changes to workflows
	•	LoRAs must be treated as drop in, parameter driven assets
	•	The same generation workflow should serve all characters
	•	The system should be built in a way that supports multiple GPU pods later
	•	The backend must allow new models or workflows to be plugged in later without major rewrites

I need a long term foundation, not a rigid one off build.

5. Asset Storage

All generated assets must:
	•	Be saved to cloud storage (S3, Supabase, or similar)
	•	Have clean URLs returned via the API
	•	Be organized in a way that supports many characters and future projects

Summary of Your Deliverable

You will deliver:
	1.	A backend service with clean API endpoints for:
	•	listing characters
	•	registering new characters (including running the LoRA training pipeline when I provide the images)
	•	generating images
	•	generating videos
	2.	A GPU powered generation pipeline that:
	•	dynamically loads LoRAs
	•	supports consistent character image generation
	•	supports character consistent video generation
	3.	A modular, scalable architecture where:
	•	I can create new characters simply by providing ~20 images
	•	The system trains the LoRA and makes it immediately usable
	•	Adding new characters is fast and requires no workflow modifications
	•	Future scaling to additional GPU pods is possible

I will build the UI separately and connect it to your API.

Let me know if everything here is clear and if you need anything else from me before starting.
